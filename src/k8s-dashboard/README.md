Kubernetes provides a UI for administering a Kubernetes cluster known as the Kubernetes Dashboard.  This dashboard is ordinarily launched using kubectl proxy which proxies connection from a localhost address to the Kubernetes apiserver.  As of 3/19/18, the proxy service was not available in the EKS preview.  As a temporary workaround, you can run the dashboard as a service behind an public facing ELB.  Follow these instructions to get the dashboard running in your environment.
